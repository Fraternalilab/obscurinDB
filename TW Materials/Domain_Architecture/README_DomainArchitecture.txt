Materials concerning Domain Architecture generation for MSc project

## Domain data v2

Materials for domain architecture 2019
- Domains by Transcript - domain boundaries for UniProt Q5VST9 (obscurin-b), A6NGQ3 (obscurin-ic), RefSeq NP_001258152 (obscurin-ic), conserved domain analysis programs PHMMER, InterPro 72.0, NCBI CD-Search. Also position-residue-domain mapping tables for each position in each architecture, and a table matching Ensembl transcript ID to corresponding RefSeq accession, UniProt accession etc.
- Domain Architecture - Again, position-residue-domain mapping tables for each position in each architecture, used to make line graph (see Domain Summary) representing domain architectures.
- Table1 - domain comparison table for domains at corresponding genomic positions for Q5VST9, NP_001258152 and the new domain architecture (2019)
- Domain Summary - Line graph summary of Domain Architecture data. Dips indicate interdomain linker sequences between domains.
- RefSeq - summary of domain boundaries taken from NP_001258152
- PHMMER - output of PHMMER domain analysis + E-values
- InterPro - output of InterPro domain analysis + E-values
- NCBI - output of CD-Search domain analysis + E-values
- CONSENSUS - table showing matching domain boundaries between NP_001258152, CD-Search, and InterPro, and the final domain boundaries from 2019 ("Canon")
- domain seqs - worksheet for retrieving domain sequences from obscurin-ic using domain boundary data
- Sheet3 - alignment of CD-Search Ig domains (T-Coffee) and positions of pathogenic or high-frequency SNVs within domains

## Domain data v1

Legacy data from previous papers
- Sheet1 - Young et al. (2001) domain boundaries
- exon table - previous vs revised nomenclature for domains per obscn exon (via Fukuzawa et al. 2005)
- Sheet4 - Young et al. (2001) domain sequences

## Domain-Structure Alignments

Alignment of PDB structures with corresponding domains
- domain boundaries from NP_001258152, CD-Search, and InterPro architectures
- also notes secondary structure present in PDB model
- was used to compare the most likely true boundaries for the domains
